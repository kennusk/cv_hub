# Architecture

> Full engineering notes — [docs/ENGINEERING.md](docs/ENGINEERING.md)

CV Hub — статический сайт-резюме, построенный как инженерная система.
Основной принцип: **Resume as Code** — резюме версионируемо, воспроизводимо и независимо от платформ.

## Stack

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Astro 7 | Static-first, zero client-JS by default, predictable build output |
| Data | YAML | Human-readable single source of truth, easy to diff and version |
| Deploy | GitHub Pages + Actions | Free, immutable builds, no runtime server |
| Styles | Plain CSS + custom properties | No build overhead, theme switching via one token file |
| Docs | DOCX / PDF / TXT | Generated from YAML at build time via docx.js (DOCX/TXT) and Playwright (PDF, two-column + a single-column ATS-safe variant) |

## Data pipeline

```
src/content/cv/{lang}.yaml         ← base CV
src/content/cv/{lang}_{spec}.yaml  ← spec delta (only overrides)
          +
     merge.mjs
          ↓
  public/cv/{lang}.yaml
  public/cv/{lang}_{spec}.yaml
          ↓
    ┌─────┴──────────────────────────┐
    ↓                                ↓
generate-resume.js             astro build
resume-export-pdf.mjs
    ↓                                ↓
DOCX / TXT / PDF              static site
```

Merge rules: scalars — spec wins; `experience` — whitelist by `company` key; arrays — spec wins whole block if present.

---

## Multi-profile system

N profiles × N languages from one YAML source.

```
en.yaml          ← full base resume
en_devops.yaml   ← DevOps delta (only what changes)
en_gamedev.yaml  ← GameDev delta
```

Adding a new profile: create a delta YAML → `merge.mjs` picks it up automatically → documents generated, routes built, download links updated. No code changes required.

**Invariant:** a profile's `slug` (routing/URL) must equal its `spec` (CV-file and download key). `merge.mjs` enforces this with a fail-fast guard, so a profile's page can never silently desync from its CV and downloads.

---

## Routing

```
/                        → default profile, default lang
/{lang}                  → default profile, other lang
/{profile}               → named profile, default lang
/{profile}/{lang}        → named profile, named lang
/showcase                → project grid
/showcase/{slug}         → case study (default lang)
/showcase/{slug}/{lang}  → case study (other lang)
/changelog               → version history
```

Language and profile are URL state — no cookies, no localStorage. Shareable, SEO-correct, zero JS dependency.

---

## Case study content blocks

Case study YAML (`public/media/projects/{slug}/`) is built from a small set of typed blocks: `text`, `image`, `video`, `code`, `divider`. Each maps to a component in `src/components/blocks/`. `video` is dual-mode — a `src` matching a YouTube URL (`youtube.com/watch`, `youtu.be`, `youtube.com/embed`) renders a responsive 16:9 iframe; anything else is treated as a local/hosted file and renders a native `<video>` (`loop: true` for a silent autoplay loop, otherwise controls + optional `poster`). `code` is a verbatim monospace block for terminal commands/snippets — no syntax-highlighting engine, deliberately, to keep the dependency count small.

Any block except `divider` accepts `anchor: "id"` for deep-linking (`/showcase/{slug}#id`), and backtick-quoted spans in prose fields (title/subtitle/body/bullets/caption) render as styled `<code>` via a shared `InlineText.astro` — both cheap, broadly useful additions rather than one-off hacks for a single case study. Full field reference and examples — `docs/INFO.md` §6, `docs/examples/example_cs.yaml`.

## Theming

Themes are CSS files that override `:root` custom properties from `global.css`.
Activated via `?theme=name` URL parameter — no JS storage, fully shareable as a link.

```
/cv_hub/?theme=frosted    ← frosted glass theme
/cv_hub/?theme=nordic     ← Nordic dark theme
```

---

## Background components

Interchangeable canvas/CSS backgrounds. Drop any one into `Layout.astro`:

| Component | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `AnimatedBackground` | CSS only | Blur orbs, no JS, disabled on mobile |
| `GalaxyBackground` | Canvas RAF | Spiral galaxy with mouse parallax |
| `PlayStationWaves` | Canvas RAF | XMB-style filled sine waves, time-of-day hue |
| `WaveLines` | Canvas RAF | XMB-style glowing stroke lines, offscreen glow compositing |

All respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: draw one static frame, cancel RAF.

## CI/CD

Three workflows, one shared pipeline:

| Workflow | Trigger | Does |
|---|---|---|
| `ci.yml` | pull request | Full generation pipeline + uploads generated resumes and site as artifacts. Never deploys. |
| `deploy.yml` | push to `main` | Same pipeline → GitHub Pages → Telegram notification |
| `release.yml` | release published | Regenerates documents and attaches PDF/DOCX/TXT to the release (skips `astro build` — a release only needs the documents) |

The five pipeline stages run as separate named steps rather than one opaque `npm run build`, so the Actions UI shows per-stage timing and the exact failure point.

```
push → main  (runner: Node 24)
  ↓
npm ci
verify chrome   (runner's preinstalled Google Chrome — no browser download)
  ↓
npm run build
  ├── cv:build          → public/cv/*.yaml
  ├── resume:generate   → DOCX + TXT
  ├── resume:pdf        → PDF via Playwright (drives system Chrome on CI)
  ├── astro build       → static site + sitemap-index.xml
  └── og:generate       → public/media/og-image-{lang}.png + dist/media/og-image-{lang}.png
  ↓
GitHub Pages deploy
  ↓
notify_telegram  (always; success / build-fail / deploy-fail)
```

The Telegram step passes secrets and context through an `env:` block (never inline `${{ }}` in shell) and skips silently if secrets are absent. Workflow: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.

**PDF browser strategy:** PDF export uses Playwright's Node API, but the browser binary differs by environment. On CI it drives the runner's **preinstalled Google Chrome** (`channel: 'chrome'`, gated on `process.env.CI`) — no browser is downloaded, which avoids `cdn.playwright.dev` download stalls that were hanging deploys. Local builds use Playwright's bundled chromium. See `src/scripts/resume-export-pdf.mjs`.

**OG-image pipeline:** `src/scripts/generate-og-image.mjs` screenshots one dedicated `/og-preview/{lang}` route per configured language (`getStaticPaths()`, `src/pages/og-preview/[lang].astro`) — each rendering the real default-profile CV from `public/cv/{lang}.yaml` (same file `index.astro` reads; falls back to `docs/examples/example_cv.yaml` only if that file doesn't exist yet) — through the same Playwright/Chrome pattern as PDF export. One image per language, not per profile or per case study: every page picks its OG image by its own `lang` (`Layout.astro`), so a `/devops` or case-study page just reuses the same-language default-profile image instead of a dedicated screenshot. Each raw screenshot is composited into a framed, wallpapered 1200×630 card on a second headless page, using the live page's own computed CSS custom properties (`--accent`, `--bg`, etc., extracted once and reused across languages — theme tokens don't depend on CV content) so the wallpaper always matches whichever theme was requested — no hardcoded colors. `--theme=<name>` picks a theme (falls back to the default look if unknown); `--wallpaper=gradient|<image path>` switches between a token-driven gradient and a static image. Runs as the last stage of `npm run build`; `og-image-{lang}.png` files are regenerated every build and `.gitignore`d — build output, like `sitemap-index.xml`, not source files. The `/og-preview/*` routes are excluded from the sitemap (`astro.config.mjs`) and deleted from `dist/` by the script right after the screenshots, so they never ship.

Run it standalone (after a fresh `astro build`) to iterate on the look without regenerating documents: `npm run og:generate -- --theme=nordic --wallpaper=docs/repo-assets/bkg-samples/wavelines_example.png`. Full CLI reference and CI wiring — `docs/INFO.md` §12.

## SEO

- `@astrojs/sitemap` generates `sitemap-index.xml` at build time, covering every profile × language route.
- `public/robots.txt` allows all and points to the sitemap.
- Per-page canonical, Open Graph and Twitter Card meta are built in `Layout.astro`, language-aware via `og:locale`.

## Key trade-offs

| Decision | Rationale |
|---|---|
| No CMS | Full control over data shape and build process |
| No SSR | Static output is sufficient; no dynamic data needed |
| Lang in URL, not cookies | SEO-correct, explicit state, no JS dependency |
| Case study YAML in `public/` | Lives next to assets; avoids Astro content collection schema for free-form content |
| Manual delta files | Explicit over magic; easy to audit what changed per profile |
